    "The data consists of one excel file with 141,646 rows and 25 columns of data. There are no missing values per se, but if the data is subset by analytical group, some sampling locations were not tested for certain parameters as the sampling program changed over the length of the dataset (10 years). I dont' believe I need to create any additional derived fields unless I do certain statistical analyses that require intermediary steps. Cleaning the data will possibly involve creating subgroups for easier analysis. For instance, Groundwater (GW) versus Surface Water (SW), and analytical groups (VOCs, SVOCS, Metals.) Some columns may be surpefluous and not used during data analysis."
